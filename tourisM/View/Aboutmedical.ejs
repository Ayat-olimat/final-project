                        <p>Hammamet Ma'in  is one of the famous tourist places in Jordan. It is about 58 m from the southern side of Amman.
                            It is also located 27 m from the city of Madaba, and is characterized by its lowness from sea level, 
                            reaching about 120 m, and perhaps the most important thing that distinguishes it is the presence of many springs inside. It reaches about 63 springs with varying temperatures, and in this article we will mention some detailed information about them in general in this report.
                           The temperature of the mineral springs in Maâ€™in reaches about 43 degrees Celsius,
                            and this water pours after its flow from the highest peaks to the bottom of the mountain, which is also 264 meters below sea level,
                             to walk warm in the valley before pouring into the Zarqa River.

                        <p>Al-Hamma is located 100 kilometers north of Amman, and is considered one of the most vital medical and tourist sites in the region.
                             A resort and some clinics have been established that provide many services to visitors to that area.
                              There is a center for people suffering from diseases and respiratory problems, 
                              as well as centers that provide treatment for skin diseases and diseases related to the nervous system and joints. On the other hand,

                        <p>Tafileh - Baths of Afra are located about 35 km north of Tafileh after passing through the Barbita torrent,
                             where a winding and bumpy road descends to the visitor to the place surrounded by high mountains on both sides.
                             They were created by the Creator's hand, as sand caves that formed a 
                             habitat for some of the inhabitants of the place, instead of homes.
                             A small number of residents live around the area and work in the cultivation of
                            vegetables that are irrigated with permanent water, and you can see vegetable farms and some types of 
                            trees on both sides that receive their water from the torrent over a distance of no less than 15 kilometers.</p>
